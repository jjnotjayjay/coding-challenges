Hibachi numbers are the series (2, 2, 2, 8, 32, 512, ...). The series starts with three twos. Each number thereafter is the product of the previous three. Write a recursive function to return the n-th Hibachi number, where n is passed in as a parameter.Â  Then create a simple interface in the html page, so that a user can enter the number, click a button, and then see the resulting hibachi number displayed below.
